# Server Authorization

**Server Authorization** can be enabled in [Unity Catalog Server](../server/index.md) using `server.authorization` property in `etc/conf/server.properties` configuration file.

To enable the server authorization `server.authorization` property should be `enable` (case-insensitive).

With server authorization enabled, Unity Catalog Server registers [AuthDecorator](AuthDecorator.md) to intercept all requests to `/api/2.1/unity-catalog/`-prefixed URLs.

## Bearer Authentication

From [OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) (extra spacing mine):

> **Bearer Authentication** (_token authentication_) is an [HTTP authentication scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication) that involves security tokens called bearer tokens.
>
> The name "Bearer authentication" can be understood as "give access to the bearer of this token."
>
> The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.
>
> The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:
>
> ```text
> Authorization: Bearer <token>
> ```
>
> The Bearer authentication scheme was originally created as part of [OAuth 2.0](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/oauth2/) in [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750).
>
> Bearer authentication should only be used over HTTPS (SSL).
